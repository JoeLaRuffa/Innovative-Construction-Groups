During my first two weeks of my internship, in order to learn the process ICG used on their production lines and become familiar with FlexSim software, I was assigned to 
model their entire roof truss line, which contained 7 tables and 25 employees. The folder contains a model of the entire roof truss system as well as a more detailed model that 
illustrates ouput of 3 tables identically to what occurs in ICG's factory. These models were used to run simulation tests on multiple scenarios including: labor shortage and 
unexpected machinary malfunction, discovering ways to reconfigure labor to maximize output.
