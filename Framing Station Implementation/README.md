My second project as an intern for ICG, was to take the information that I learned studying the framing station on the company's Weinmann #1 line and predict potential
throughput on a hypothetical interior line that contained a framing station. The purpose of this project was to support the compnay's hypothesis that inputting a framing station
on an interior line in their second plant would help them reach their goal of 2000 linear ft per 10 hr shift. The main problem was figuring out how long the average interior wall
would take on the framing station, based on timing the exterior wall line. I ended up breaking down the timing into 4 categories: Computer Time, Set-up, Nailing, Move to Queue 
(Move to queue and Computer Time remain constant and were carried over from the Weinmann #1 line). The nailing time was calculated based on the number of stops the framing machine 
would have to perform for each wall (this number was averaged based on all interior walls used to build a Mystique Pulte house). The set-up time was calculated based on a function
I developed that considered each time while a component is being nailed, number of studs, and number of sub-components. I modeled the existing and potential interior line using 
FlexSim and will include it in this folder.
